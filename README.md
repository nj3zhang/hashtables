# Hash tables
Implemented Hash tables with different collision handling techniques in C++ (chaining and double hashing)
Hash Table is used to store phone numbers and caller ID

- Included executables and sample tests

Open addressing (Double hashing):
`./openhttest < test1.in`

Ordered chaining:
`./orderedhttest < test2.in`
